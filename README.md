# LBPWatchAppExample
An example project with watchOS 2.

This example is based on a Ray Wenderlich tutorial. http://www.raywenderlich.com/

This is a watchOS app for a fictional airline called Air Aber. With the app you can:
- List the flights.
- Navigate to details of a flight.
- Do the check-in of a flight.
- See the QRCode of a flight that you already did the check-in.
